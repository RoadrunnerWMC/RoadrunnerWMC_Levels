# RoadrunnerWMC's Sept. 2021 NSMBW Level Contest Entry

**NOTE:** This is the "spoiler-free" readme. If/when you're comfortable with spoilers for this level, [you can see see the rest of the readme here](README_spoilers.md).

## Introduction

This is my entry for the September 2021 NSMBW Level Contest, which was a collaboration between the NSMBW Hacking Depot and Horizon Discord servers. The contest theme was "indoors".

**This level is not compatible with multiplayer mode, as the contest rules stated that multiplayer functionality would not be considered.**

The level has 3 star coins and a secret exit.

## How To Play
